Friendship...  
What a peculiar thing.  

We were but strangers,  
cold and alone.  
Yet, a flame still kindled  
into being.  

Day unto day,  
Month unto month,  
Year unto year.  

The blaze of yesterday  
is but embers today.  

What remains of the furnace?  
Neglected, abandoned, forgotten.  

Remember the warmth.  
Remember the solace.  
Remember the memories.  

Stoke the furnace.  
Let it light once more.
